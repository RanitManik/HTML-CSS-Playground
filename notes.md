### Types of Elements in HTML

1. **Block Elements**:

    - The element will start on a new line and occupy the full width available. You can set width and height values.

2. **Inline Elements**:

    - The element doesn't start on a new line and only occupies just the width it requires. You can't set the width or
      height.

3. **Inline Block Elements**:

    - It's formatted just like the inline element, where it doesn't start on a new line. BUT, you can set width and
      height
      values.

*Note*: `div` by default is a block element. It's a container that contains a group of elements. Block elements take up
their line in their container (div). Images overflow. To set the image size to its container size, use the
property `width: 100%`. To align, use the `vertical-align` property. Font-stack lets us support a backup font.
